Of course, the CIFAR-10 is among one of these datasets, and the lowest score posted there is 75.86%. Given the short(er) time frame to learn about neural networks (mostly on my own, but not without some help from Joshua Cook and Mike Frantz), my benchmark was to at least match this lowest score."

Though this was an inteeresting exercise, the logistic regerssion method scored an unimpressive 32% test accuracy (again, please see the \"Part 2 - Image Classification Capstone - John Hou\" notebook that I referenced in the EDA section above).\n",

    "1) The convolutional neural net architecture that I implemented was fairly standard and not overly complex. Two full cycles (where each cycle consists of 2 convolutions, each followed by a standard ReLU activation, which was then followed by a MaxPooling and Dropout) with a fully connected layer at the end is very basic. Please see either the cifar10fromkeras.py in the **code** folder or the screenshot_convnet_arch image in the **misc** folder to see the structure. \n",

    "2) Due to consistent problems (see Challenges section below), I was only able to successfully run 20 epochs. Even with this limited approach, my validation accuracy started at 22% for the 1st epoch and eventually reached 61% by the 20th epoch. Clearly, the ConvNet was learning, and it is clearly possible that it could've have learned more, given more epochs.\n",

    "3) I really made an effort to understand the nitty gritty details under the hood regarding neural networks and convnets specifically. This was quite a challenge. Even though I utilized the well constructed Stanford CS231N course (http://cs231n.github.io/), I believe that this course may have been too much to digest in a short time period. This course also isn't the best course for beginners like myself. I spent too much time trying to understand dense material, instead of spending that time tinkering with Keras (which would have been a wiser option, given the limited time frame)."

He was also the one that framed my capstone as an opportunity to really explore something on my own. I thank him for introducing me to this subject and for helping me along the way."
